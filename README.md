# LLM from Scratch

This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of a modern decoder-only Transformer model in PyTorch.


## Features

* **From-Scratch Implementation:** Every component of the Transformer model is implemented from scratch using PyTorch, providing a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
* **Modern Architecture:** The model incorporates modern techniques used in state-of-the-art language models, including:
  * **RMSNorm:** for efficient and stable layer normalization.
  * **SwiGLU:** activation function in the feed-forward network for improved performance.
  * **Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE):** for effective positional encoding.
* **Custom BPE Tokenizer:** A from-scratch implementation of the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer, which can be trained on any text corpus.
* **Custom Optimizers:** Includes custom implementations of `AdamW` and `SGDDecay` optimizers.
* **Comprehensive Training and Generation Scripts:** Provides scripts for training the model on a large corpus and for generating text with a trained model.
* **Thorough Testing:** A comprehensive test suite using `pytest` and snapshot testing ensures the correctness of the implementation.

## Implemented Components

This project provides a complete ecosystem for building and training a language model. The key components are:

### Core Model (`llm/transformer.py`)

* **`Transformer`**: The main model class that combines all the components.
* **`TransformerBlock`**: A single block of the Transformer, containing multi-head attention and a feed-forward network.
* **`MultiHeadAttention`**: The multi-head self-attention mechanism.
* **`ScaledDotProductAttention`**: The core attention mechanism.
* **`FFN`**: The position-wise feed-forward network with SwiGLU activation.
* **`RoPE`**: Rotary Position Embeddings for injecting positional information.
* **`RmsNorm`**: Root Mean Square Layer Normalization.
* **`Embedding`**: The token embedding layer.
* **`Linear`**: A custom linear layer.
* **`Softmax`**: A custom softmax implementation.
* **`CrossEntropyLoss`**: A custom cross-entropy loss function.

### Tokenizer (`llm/bpe_tokenizer.py`)

* **`BpeTokenizer`**: A from-scratch implementation of the BPE tokenizer. It can be trained on a corpus to learn a vocabulary and merges. It also supports special tokens.

### Training and Inference

* **`llm/training.py`**: A script for training the Transformer model. It includes data loading, a training loop, validation, and checkpointing.
* **`llm/generating.py`**: A script for generating text using a trained model with top-p sampling.
* **`llm/checkpoint.py`**: Utilities for saving and loading model checkpoints.

### Optimizers and Utilities (`llm/transformer.py`)

* **`AdamW`**: A custom implementation of the AdamW optimizer.
* **`SGDDecay`**: A custom implementation of SGD with learning rate decay.
* **`cos_lr_scheduler`**: A cosine learning rate scheduler with warmup.
* **`gradient_clip`**: A function for gradient clipping.

## Architecture

The Transformer model in this repository is a decoder-only model, similar to the architecture of models like GPT. It is designed for language modeling tasks. The key architectural features are:

* **Pre-Normalization:** The model uses RMSNorm for layer normalization, which is applied *before* the attention and feed-forward layers. This leads to more stable training compared to post-normalization.
* **SwiGLU Activation:** The feed-forward network uses the SwiGLU (Swish-Gated Linear Unit) activation function, which has been shown to improve performance in language models.
* **Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE):** Instead of traditional positional embeddings, this model uses RoPE to incorporate positional information by rotating the query and key vectors in the attention mechanism. This is a more effective way to handle long sequences.

## Usage

### 1. Preparing the Data

The training script expects the training and validation data to be in the form of memory-mapped numpy arrays of token IDs. You can use the trained tokenizer to convert your text data into this format.

Downloading data by

```bash
mkdir -p data
cd data

wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-train.txt
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-valid.txt

wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanford-cs336/owt-sample/resolve/main/owt_train.txt.gz
gunzip owt_train.txt.gz
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanford-cs336/owt-sample/resolve/main/owt_valid.txt.gz
gunzip owt_valid.txt.gz

cd ..
```

### 2. Training the Tokenizer

You can train the BPE tokenizer on your own text corpus using the `llm/bpe_tokenizer.py` script.

Preparing token ids for training

```bash

uv run -m llm.bpe_tokenizer
```

### 3. Training the Model

The `llm/training.py` script is used to train the Transformer model.

```bash
uv run -m llm.training
```

### 4. Generating Text

Once you have a trained model, you can use `llm/generating.py` to generate text.

```bash
uv run -m llm.generating
```

## Testing

This project has a comprehensive test suite to ensure the correctness of the implementation. You can run the tests using `pytest`:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

The tests cover:

* The correctness of each module in the Transformer model by comparing its output with reference implementations.
* The BPE tokenizer's encoding and decoding, as well as its training process.
* The optimizers and other utilities.
